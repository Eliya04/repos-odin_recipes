       <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
       <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
       <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>

     <ol>
         <li>Combine brown sugar, salt, and water in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until caramel is very dark, and bubbles appear, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat.</li>
         <li>Carefully whisk in 2 tablespoons butter; pour in heavy cream and continue to stir. Be careful, as mixture may boil up in the pan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Whisk in milk.</li>
         <li>Whisk whole egg, egg yolks, and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch together in a mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of hot cream mixture to temper egg mixture. Whisk egg mixture into the saucepan and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer, and cook, whisking, until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.</li>
         <li>Remove from heat and pour into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl to remove any lumps. Whisk in rum</li>
         <li>Pour into serving glasses. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, before wrapping in plastic wrap and refrigerating until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
